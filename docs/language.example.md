# Language Name — Reference Notes

A concise, **best-of reference** for Language Name.

This is not a tutorial — it captures syntax, patterns, and behaviors
that are **unique, important, easy to forget, or different from other languages**.

## How to Use This File

This file is intentionally unstructured beyond the frontmatter and title.

Everyone learns and references languages differently. Your goal is not completeness — it’s usefulness.

Design this file so that future-you can answer questions like:

- “How does this work again?”
- “What’s different here compared to other languages?”
- “What syntax or behavior do I always forget?”

## Getting Started

1. Copy the frontmatter at the top of this file and update:
   - `language`
   - `slug`
   - `last_updated`
   - `official_docs`
2. Rename the file to match the language. Example:
   ```
   python.md
   javascript.md
   php.md
   ```
3. Update the main heading:
   ```
   # Python — Reference Notes
   ```

That’s it. Everything after that is up to you.

## How to Organize Your Notes

There is no required heading structure. Organize your notes in a way that feels natural to you. Common approaches include:

- Grouping by data type, (e.g. all list methods, all string methods in one place)
- Grouping by concept, (functions, scope, arguments, async behavior, etc.)
- Grouping by “things I forget”, (edge cases, defaults, implicit behavior)
- Grouping by language-specific features, (things that don’t exist elsewhere or behave differently)

Keep entries short, concise, and example-driven.
